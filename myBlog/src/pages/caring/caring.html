                  1. The first thing you want to do is decide whether you want to adopt a kitten or an adult cat. 
                  If you want to get a kitten, you better prepare yourself because kittens are mostly playful and 
                  energetic. Adult cats however are calmer and quieter but may have behavioural issues due to its 
                  early life. So think carefully on what you want.

                  2. Ask medical conditions on a specific cat. Always consider the breed of the cat you’re about 
                  to choose. Mixed and purebred cats often differ in different genetic problems.

                  3. Consider your free time. Cats are independent animals but that doesn’t mean that they don’t 
                  need your attention. They’re active pets that need time and commitment and all the love and 
                  affection you can give them.

                  <h1>
                  4. Calculate whether you can afford a cat. Cats in the Philippines usually cost around Php5,000 
                  and above, depending on what breed you’re getting, its age, and whether or not it has its shots 
                  done. You’ll also need to prepare for medical fees when your cat gets sick.
